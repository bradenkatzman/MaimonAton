** Project Under Construction **

MaimonAton is my senior capstone project that incorporates my two B.A.s, Computer Science and Jewish Philosophy.
MaimonAton is an interactive program that allows users to "ask" Maimonides, a 12th century Jewish philosopher,
questions pertaining to his philosophies. The program has 3 components which are as follows:

1. An internal database which contains raw text from Maimonides' works that are categorized into the following topics:
     - Negative Theology
     - Biomedical Ethics
     - Mean between two extremes
     - Philosophical influences (primarily Aristotle)
  Answers to users' questions are queried using Nature Language Processing techniques which process questions by
  their types (how, why, what, tell me about... questions) and then uses text matching and predictive models to
  query appropriate responses from the database.

2. A UI component that allows users to speak to directly to the program. Using Google's Cloud Speech API (beta), a speech
   to text conversion powered by machine learning, the program converts spoken questions to text to then be processed and
   used to query responses from the database.

3. A UI components that animates a 3D rendered head of Maimonides to "speak" the responses back to the user.


After building this for my capstone project, I hope to develop this into educational software.
